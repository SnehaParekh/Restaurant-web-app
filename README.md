# Restaurant-web-app
Web application made using AngularJS for the fictional conFusion Resturant. Made this while learning Angular framework for the first time via Coursera. This application allows the user to glance through the menu, filter it for personal preferences, submit ratings, send a message if they have an inquiry or complain, and also, pre-book table.
